# JATE
Just Another Text Editor (JATE), pronounced, "jot", is an open-sourced text-editor for the Android platform with syntax highlighting.

For this, I plan on following the K.I.S.S. (Keep It Stupid Simple) method. That means no additional features, it's just a straight up, plan-ol text editor.
No fancy unicorn magic. After all, it's just another text editor.


# FAQ

Q: Why are you making this?

A: I honestly just wanted to, and it seemed like a good challenge for me. However, that means there's a large potential for what seems unconventional. If you see anything, feel free to open an issue for me to look at. I don't mind being corrected!

Q: Do you have any future plans for JATE?

A: Maybe a Pro version with more features (Google Firebase integration, cloud integration...). For now, I want to keep close to the K.I.S.S. method.

# What's completed so far

- Custom editor activity with line numbering.

- Saving with confirmation if you want to overwrite files (also placed into an asynctask in case someone wants to load up a large file).

# To do (current roadmap)

- Implement file loading.

- Changelog dialog?

- Custom view to show recently opened files.

- Figure out what to do with the nav drawer. Not sure if I even want to keep that (but it's nice having the option anyway in the codebase so far).
